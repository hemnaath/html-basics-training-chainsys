            The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5682+0.0002 −0.0004 Ga (billion years) ago. By 4.54±0.04 Ga the 
            primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions 
            a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and 
            then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides). 
            According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking 
            anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form.

            Estimates of the age of the Moon range from 4.5 Ga to significantly younger. A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by 
            accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object with about 10% of Earth's mass, named Theia, collided with 
            Earth.[40] It hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth. Between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 Ga, 
            numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the 
            Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.
