        <h1>Weather and Climate</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the 
            atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11 km (6.8 mi) of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. 
            Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises 
            and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through 
            redistribution of thermal energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies 
            in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°. Ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the 
            thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight 
            reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air 
            temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4 °C (0.7 °F) per degree of latitude from the equator. Earth's surface can be 
            subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, 
            these are the tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar climates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Further factors that affect a location's climates are its proximity to oceans, the oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and topology.
            Places close to oceans typically have colder summers and warmer winters, due to the fact that oceans can store large amounts of heat. 
            The wind transports the cold or the heat of the ocean to the land. Atmospheric circulation also plays an important role: San Francisco and 
            Washington DC are both coastal cities at about the same latitude. San Francisco's climate is significantly more moderate as the prevailing 
            wind direction is from sea to land. Finally, temperatures decrease with height causing mountainous areas to be colder than low-lying areas.
