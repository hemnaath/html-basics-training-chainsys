            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbour and support life. 
            About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, 
            mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which together
            constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several 
            rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years, while its interior remains active with a 
            solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convective mantle that drives plate 
            tectonics.

            Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions 
            and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Greenhouse gases also play an important role in regulating the surface 
            temperature. A region's climate is not only determined by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans, 
            among other factors. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly 
            impacts life.

            Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. 
            Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, 
            producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation 
            on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive 
            of the four rocky planets.

            According to radiometric dating estimation and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Within the first 
            billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading 
            to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen 
            as early as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, 
            and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of life on Earth, biodiversity has gone 
            through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinctions. More than 99% of all species that ever lived 
            on Earth are extinct. Almost 8 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival. 
            Humans increasingly impact Earth's surface, hydrology, atmospheric processes, and other life.
