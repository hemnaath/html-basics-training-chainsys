        <h1>Future</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Because carbon dioxide (CO2) has a long lifespan in the atmosphere, moderate human CO2 emissions may postpone the next glacial 
            inception by 100,000 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 
            10%, and over the next 3.5 billion years by 40%. Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon 
            cycle, reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 100–900 
            million years.[78][79] The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible. 
            Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's mean temperature may reach 100 °C (212 °F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will 
            evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years. Even if 
            the Sun were stable, a fraction of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from 
            mid-ocean ridges.
        </p>

            The Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5 billion years. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1 AU 
            (150 million km; 93 million mi), about 250 times its present radius. Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose 
            roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7 AU (250 million km; 160 million mi) from the 
            Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius, otherwise, with tidal effects, it may enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.
